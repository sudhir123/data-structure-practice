 * two ways to do this : 1) divide the array in two equal parts 0 to n/2-1 and n/2 to n-1
 * while adding to first stack just offset is less than n/2-1. So does the other.
 * Issue with this is, that this is not space efficient becase lets say we added 3 elements to first and none in second
 * when we try to push forth in first we will stack overflow
 * stack is Last in first out
