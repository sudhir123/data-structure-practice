 * The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence
 * such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. For example, the length of LIS for
 * {10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80} is 6 and LIS is {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}.
